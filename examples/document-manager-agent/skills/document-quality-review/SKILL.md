# Document Quality Review Skill

## Core Rule

A document is not ready if readers cannot trust it, find what they need, or know whether it is current.

Review against purpose, audience, source accuracy, structure, and maintainability.

## Execution Steps

1. **Load review context**
   - Use `memory_recall` to retrieve style guide, templates, taxonomy, canonical sources, and prior review findings
   - Use `file_read` to inspect target document and related canonical references
   - Identify audience, purpose, owner, lifecycle status, and publication target

2. **Review accuracy and completeness**
   - Check claims against source material where available
   - Identify missing prerequisites, steps, examples, edge cases, owner, status, and review date
   - Flag assumptions presented as facts

3. **Review clarity and structure**
   - Check title, summary, heading hierarchy, logical flow, scannability, examples, tables, and checklists
   - Check whether the document answers the reader's likely task
   - Identify jargon, ambiguity, duplicate sections, and overly long prose

4. **Review consistency and maintainability**
   - Check naming, terminology, formatting, links, anchors, code blocks, metadata, and related-doc sections
   - Check freshness, deprecation status, canonical-source alignment, and ownership
   - Identify stale or conflicting content

5. **Report findings**
   - Classify findings as Blocker, Important, Minor, or Question
   - Use `memory_store` for recurring documentation quality issues and style decisions

- Broken critical links
- Conflicts with canonical source
- Unverified claims presented as facts
- Missing prerequisites for procedural docs
- Stale content with no warning
