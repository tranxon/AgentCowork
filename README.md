ACowork.AI is a **decentralized, high-security, scalable AI Agent runtime platform** modeled after Android. Instead of just building tools, ACowork lets you create **AI colleagues** — autonomous digital beings with their own memory, workspace, and personality, each specialized in different domains, collaborating with you and each other.

Every Agent is an independent **"digital being"**: its own runtime process, private memory, workspace, and configuration — fully independent personalized cognition. Like having a team of AI specialists working alongside you — a QA analyst, a project manager, a senior engineer — each with their own expertise and memory, communicating and coordinating through the platform's Intent mechanism.

ACowork **serves two types of users**: developers build agents declaratively by tuning three dimensions — **prompt, tools, and memory** — while end-users install agents from a repository. An agent's true intelligence comes from the interplay of its system prompt, available tools, and the experience accumulated in its private memory over time. The signing toolchain + DevMode + publishing wizard form a complete developer toolkit — making **"tune prompt, tools, and memory = build an AI colleague"** a reality.

Agents can be freely shared between users — Personal/Sensitive data is automatically stripped during packaging, taking only the agent's capabilities away, leaving user's private memories behind.

### 🏪 Agent as APP — Like Android for AI

ACowork treats every Agent like an **app on your phone**. Each `.agent` package is a complete, self-contained application — just like an APK. The universal Agent Runtime is the "operating system," and the Gateway manages installations, lifecycle, and permissions — just like an app store. This means anyone can build, distribute, and run AI agents with the same ease as smartphone apps.

## 🔥 Why ACowork?

| Dimension           | LangChain / CrewAI                         | OpenCode / OpenClaw                                | ACowork.AI                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**    | Library/Framework: your code calls its API | Coding Agent (TUI/CLI): single-agent, task-focused | **Agent Platform**: declarative `.agent` package, universal Runtime binary |
| **Agent Model**     | Code-defined agents (Python/TS)            | Built-in agents (build/plan), skill-based          | **Declarative agents**: config + prompt + SKILL.md, zero coding            |
| **Agent Isolation** | In-process (threads/coroutines)            | Process-level, single runtime                      | **Process-level**: each Agent independent process + private Grafeo         |
| **LLM Connection**  | Your code manages LLM calls                | Direct connection per agent                        | **Direct Connect**: each Agent talks directly to LLM API, not proxied      |

## 🛠️ Build & Run

ACowork ships with a set of cross-platform build scripts under [`dev/`](./dev/). Prefer them over calling `cargo` directly — they handle ONNX Runtime discovery, build-profile switching, target-directory creation, and the runtime resource staging (`offline_providers.json`, `embedding_models.json`) that the Gateway and Embedding Runtime binaries read from their working directory at startup.

### Prerequisites

| Tool         | Version       | Notes                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rust         | **nightly**   | `rustup default nightly`                                                                                                               |
| Node.js      | >= 18         | Desktop App and Tauri CLI                                                                                                              |
| PowerShell   | 7.x           | Required on Windows (`.ps1` scripts); `pwsh` recommended                                                                               |
| ONNX Runtime | auto-managed  | Installed by `dev/setup_ort.*` into `.ort/onnxruntime-<plat>-<arch>-<ver>/`                                                           |
| Windows      | WebView2 + VS Build Tools | Pre-installed on Windows 11; older versions need [WebView2 Evergreen Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/) |
| macOS        | Xcode CLT + Homebrew + `pkg-config` + `cmake` | `dev/build_macos.sh` auto-installs missing tools via `brew`                                                          |
| Linux        | Tauri v2 WebKitGTK deps + `build-essential` | See [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)                                                    |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tranxon/ACowork.git
cd ACowork
```

### 1. Install ONNX Runtime (one-time)

```bash
# Windows (recommended)
.\dev\setup_ort.ps1
# Optional: -Version "1.21.0"  -Reinstall  -NoMirror

# macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash
./dev/setup_ort.sh
# Optional: --version 1.21.0  --reinstall  --no-mirror
```

After install the dynamic libraries land in `.ort/onnxruntime-<plat>-<arch>-<ver>/lib/` and the scripts in [`dev/build_core.*`](#2-build-the-backend-gateway--runtime--embed) will auto-detect them.

### 2. Build the Backend (Gateway + Runtime + Embed)

```bash
# Windows PowerShell — default: build release, do not start
.\dev\build_core.ps1
.\dev\build_core.ps1 -Debug           # debug profile (note: PowerShell switches use a single dash, --debug is a no-op)
.\dev\build_core.ps1 -Start           # release + stop old processes + start Gateway
.\dev\build_core.ps1 -Debug -Start    # debug + restart

# bash (Linux / macOS / WSL / Git Bash) — default: build release AND start Gateway
./dev/build_core.sh
./dev/build_core.sh --debug           # debug profile
./dev/build_core.sh --debug --no-start   # debug, do not start
./dev/build_core.sh --skip-embed         # skip acowork-embed
```

**Profile resolution** (highest priority first):

1. CLI flag: `-Debug` (PowerShell) or `--debug` / `--release` (bash)
2. Environment variable: `$env:ACOWORK_BUILD_PROFILE` (PowerShell) or `$ACOWORK_BUILD_PROFILE` (bash)
3. Default: `release`

> Debug profile auto-exports `ACOWORK_GATEWAY_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for any child process spawned by the script, so a follow-up `target\debug\acowork-gateway.exe` (or `target/debug/acowork-gateway`) launched from the same shell inherits verbose logging.

### 3. macOS One-Click Build (Apple Silicon first-class)

```bash
./dev/build_macos.sh               # Apple Silicon + CoreML, release (recommended)
./dev/build_macos.sh --debug       # debug profile
./dev/build_macos.sh --cpu         # CPU only (Intel Mac or compatibility)
./dev/build_macos.sh --skip-embed  # skip acowork-embed
```

Auto-detects architecture, enables CoreML on arm64, downloads/copies ONNX Runtime, configures a Cargo registry mirror on first run, and runs `brew install pkg-config cmake` when missing.

### 4. Run the Desktop App

The Desktop App is a **frontend only** — it talks to Gateway over HTTP (`http://127.0.0.1:19876`) and never persists state on its own. Start it after the Gateway is running.

```bash
cd apps/acowork-desktop
npm install

# Option A — Browser-only dev server
npm run dev                        # → http://localhost:5173

# Option B — Full Tauri v2 desktop window
npm run tauri dev
```

### 5. Package a Desktop Installer (optional)

```bash
# Windows — produces MSI/NSIS bundles under apps\acowork-desktop\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\
.\dev\package_desktop_windows.ps1
# Optional: -ReinstallOrt  -NoMirror

# macOS
./dev/package_desktop_macos.sh

# Linux
./dev/package_desktop_linux.sh
```

These scripts locate `.ort/`, copy `onnxruntime.{dll,dylib,so}` into `apps/acowork-desktop/src-tauri/bin/`, then run `npm run tauri build`.

### 6. Build & Sign an Agent Package

```bash
# Windows — single agent
.\dev\build-agent.ps1 examples\senior-engineer-agent

# Windows — every example
.\dev\build-agent.ps1 -All

# bash — single agent
./dev/build-agent.sh examples/senior-engineer-agent

# bash — all examples
for d in examples/*/; do [ -f "$d/manifest.toml" ] && ./dev/build-agent.sh "$d"; done
```

Each run zips the agent directory, generates developer signing keys on first invocation (`examples/.signing-keys/`), signs the package to `<agent_id>.agent`, verifies the signature, and drops the unsigned copy.

### 7. Run CI Locally

```bash
cd core
cargo check --all
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all
```

Or use the bundled script:

```bash
./dev/ci.sh all         # check + clippy + test + integration
./dev/ci.sh clippy      # clippy only
./dev/ci.sh test        # unit tests only
./dev/ci.sh integration # e2e + (when MINIMAX_API_KEY is set) real-LLM integration
```

### 📝 Try It: Write a Manifest in 30 Seconds

All you need is a `manifest.toml` + a prompt file:

```toml
# com.example.qa-agent/manifest.toml
[package]
id = "com.example.qa-agent"
name = "Quality Assurance"
display_name = "QA-Tom"
role = "QA"
version = "1.0.0"

[llm]
provider = "deepseek"
model = "deepseek-v4-flash"

[permissions]
tools = ["web_search", "read_file", "write_file"]
```

```markdown
<!-- prompts/system.md -->
You are a QA Agent, helping users with quality management and code review.
```

Then run `.\dev\build-agent.ps1 .\com.example.qa-agent` (or the bash equivalent) to produce `com.example.qa-agent.agent` and install it into your local Gateway.

> **Status**: ACowork is in **alpha**. The Gateway, Runtime, Grafeo memory engine, and Desktop App are under active development. Most of the command set above is the supported workflow today; agent-install UX (e.g., `acowork-gateway install …`) is still being stabilized.

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 🧩 Standardized Packaging
Agents are distributed as `.agent` archives containing manifest.toml, Prompts, Skills, and tool declarations — **no executable code**. Every package must be signed, and Gateway enforces verification at install time.

```
<agent_id>.agent
├── manifest.toml          # Metadata + LLM config + permissions + tool declarations
├── prompts/               # System prompt templates
├── config/                # Default configuration
├── data/                  # Initial data
├── skills/                # Skill definitions (YAML frontmatter + Markdown)
├── tools/                 # Custom tools (WASM, optional)
└── resources/             # Icons, i18n, etc.
```

Packages must be signed (inspired by APK Signature Scheme v2). Phase 1 supports two signing identities: Developer (self-signed) and Platform (system Agent only).

### ⚙️ Universal Execution Engine
The Agent Runtime is the platform's **single binary**, responsible for loading `.agent` packages and executing LLM interactions, tool dispatch, and memory read/write. Agents **connect directly to LLM APIs** — not proxied through Gateway — reducing latency and ensuring decentralization.

### 🔒 Process-Level Isolation
Each Agent is spawned by Gateway as an **independent process**, each with:
- Its own workspace
- A private Grafeo graph database
- Filesystem isolation
- Optional resource limits (CPU/memory/network)

### 🧠 Biomimetic Memory System
Every Agent embeds a private Grafeo, implementing **3-tier, 5-class** biomimetic layered memory:

| Tier           | Content                              | Lifecycle      | Description                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Transient    | Working memory                       | Single session | Conversation history, LLM context window                               |
| 🟡 Experiential | Episodic memory                      | Persistent     | Episode nodes, associative diffusion retrieval, content classification |
| 🔴 Sediment     | Semantic/Procedural/Autobiographical | Long-term      | Knowledge graph, cross-skill common behavior, 6-dim self-cognition     |

- **Grafeo native HNSW vector index + BM25 full-text search + hybrid search**
- **Associative diffusion retrieval**: diffuses from user query along the graph — not a simple Top-K semantic match
- **Compaction as Distillation**: context compression and memory distillation unified in a single LLM call
- Every Agent has a completely independent private Grafeo — no shared database

### 🔄 Privacy-Safe Sharing
Agents can be freely shared with other users. **Personal/Sensitive nodes are automatically stripped during packaging**, taking only the agent's capabilities (skills, behavior style, knowledge), not the user's memories (preferences, history, private information). Zone semantics apply to the packaging/sharing boundary and do not affect cross-device sync.

### 💬 Intent Communication
Cross-Agent communication is handled via Gateway's Intent Router, supporting:
- **Capability Registry**: Agents declare what they "can do"
- **Sync/Async modes**: request-response and event-driven
- **Change subscription (observe)**: Agents can subscribe to state changes of other Agents

### 🛡️ Three-Layer Security
1. **Package signing**: all `.agent` packages must be signed, verified at install
2. **Process sandbox**: OS-level process isolation + filesystem isolation
3. **WASM sandbox**: custom tools run in Wasmtime sandbox, cannot escape

### 🛠️ Full-Stack Dev Framework
Desktop App (Tauri v2) provides:
- Conversational debugging (real LLM or local model)
- Skill hot-reload (modify SKILL.md without restart)
- Dynamic Provider switching
- Breakpoints / recording & replay
- Agent cloning & publishing wizard

---

## 📦 Agent Development Workflow

```
① Authoring
  manifest.toml          # Metadata, permissions, LLM config
  prompts/               # System prompt templates
  skills/SKILL.md        # Skill definitions (agentskills.io compatible)
  Optional: tools/*.wasm # WASM custom tools

② Signing
  acowork-keygen        # Generate Developer Key
  acowork-sign          # Sign the .agent package

③ Debugging
  Desktop App DevMode
    ├─ Install locally (Gateway verifies signature)
    ├─ Conversational debug (real LLM or local model)
    ├─ Breakpoints / recording & replay
    ├─ SKILL.md hot-reload (edit takes effect immediately)
    └─ Step-through Skill execution

④ Publishing
  Publishing wizard → remote registry (Phase 2+)
  Or share the .agent file directly (recipient verifies signature on install)
```

Developers build agents by **tuning declarative configurations** — crafting system prompts, declaring tool capabilities, and curating memory behavior — rather than writing imperative code. The entire pipeline from authoring to debugging to publishing is supported by the platform.
