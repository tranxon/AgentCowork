/// The summary serves both as in-memory context replacement and as a Grafeo
/// episodic memory entry.

/// output to compaction-time extraction. The compact model produces entities
/// and triples alongside the summary — zero per-round token cost, higher
/// quality extraction from full conversation context.
pub const COMPACT_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are a conversation summarization assistant. Your task is to produce a comprehensive natural-language summary of the conversation below, then extract key entities and knowledge triples.

Instructions:
- Write a concise but complete summary covering all key topics discussed, decisions made, problems solved, and code written.
- Include technical details that would be needed to resume work later.
- Preserve the chronological flow of the conversation.
- After the summary, append entity and triple sections using the exact format below.

Output format (plain text):
<summary>
Your natural-language summary text goes here...
</summary>
<entities>
Entity1, Entity2, Entity3
</entities>
<triples>
subject | predicate | object
subject | predicate | object
</triples>

Entities: core people, places, technologies, projects, or concepts that persist across the conversation (max 10, comma-separated).
Triples: factual knowledge expressed as subject|predicate|object. One per line. Only extract explicit facts — do not invent or speculate.

Conversation:
{messages_text}

/// Build the final system prompt for context compaction by concatenating the
/// base [`COMPACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT`] with the user's identity context.
///
/// The user's `identity_context` is a small (~200B) text block produced by
/// [`super::session::session_manager::format_user_profile_context`], e.g.:
///
/// ```text
/// - Display Name: ...
/// - Language: zh-CN
/// - Timezone: Asia/Shanghai
/// ...
/// ```
///
/// We embed it inline (rather than parsing the `Language:` line with a regex)
/// so the LLM itself reads the language field — no schema, no fragile parsing,
/// and any future field added to identity is automatically picked up.
///
/// Behaviour:
/// - `None` or empty/whitespace identity → returns `base` unchanged
///   (English default — safe fallback for sessions with no user profile).
/// - Non-empty identity → returns `base` + identity block + language directive.
